          <p>
            I have always been captivated by the process of finding the best
            solutions to intricate problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love delving into areas that I haven't been exposed to before,
            where I'm all but assured to learn something new and interesting. It
            is for this reason that I particularly enjoy exploring different
            programming languages and design paradigms. I've created this
            webpage as on ongoing project to showcase who I am and what I love.
            Built entirely using vanilla JS/HTML/CSS, I plan to revise parts of
            or the whole page as I learn more and wish to challenge myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my leisure time I like to try my hand at cooking fresh new
            dishes, playing around on the trumpet or keyboard, learning about
            about skills I've never touched before, and reading speculative
            fiction and fantasy novels.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been described as a diligent, detail conscious problem solver
            and I am keen to contribute and develop my skills and knowledge in a
            fast-paced, challenging work environment.
